These our the
[ron](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron) examples.

In the tests directory you can drop in here any one
of the tests from 
[here](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron/tests) 
and they should work just fine.
The one test in this repo will serve as a model from
which you can tweak and replace without checking in any
more of the original test files.

Of course you are more than welcome to try out some on your own.
